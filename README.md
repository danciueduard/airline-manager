# Airline Manager
> Currently in very early phases

An airline manager browser game that will allow the user to purchase planes, hire staff, manage airports, create and manage routes, implement multiplayer, enable trade and mouch more.
For the map I used Leaflet and for the DB I will use Supabase. For the routing I used React Router and for the styling I used styled-components.
The game is made out of pure passion for aviation and it's ment to be a browser game at first and later if it's possible to be converted in an android/iOS app.

 Possible features
 - implement multiplayer
 - allow to add friends
 - implement chat
 - add events (bad weather, mechanical problems, staff issues, all based on how good you manage your company)
 - add discounts
 - manage ground services
and more...

The project remained public for portfolio purposes. Feel free to use my code if it helps you in any way.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh
